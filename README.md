## About

A barebone plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you write actual arrow characters without having to copy-paste them.

## Features

Write `->` and it will get replaced by `→`.

You can also use the included "Replace arrows in current file" command to replace the arrows in files you created before installing the plugin.

See the [“Usage” section](#usage) for the full list of supported arrows.

## Installation

1. Get the `manifest.json` and `main.js` files associated with the [latest release](https://github.com/xefyrdev/obsidian-arrows/releases).
2. Navigate to your vault's folder and open the `.obsidian` folder.
3. Create a folder named `obsidian-arrows`.
4. Copy the `manifest.json` and `main.js` files you just downloaded.

## Usage

- Type `->` for `→`.
- Type `<-` for `←`.
- Type `=>` for `⇒`.
- Type `<=` for `⇐`.
- Type `<>` for `↔`.
- Type `~~>` for `↝`.
- Type `<~~` for `↜`.
- Type `L>` for `↳`.
- Type `<L` for `↲`.
- Type `I->` for `↦`.
- Type `<-I` for `↤`.
- Type `->I` for `⇥`.
